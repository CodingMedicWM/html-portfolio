<h1>The Best Movies According to Ope</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr/ >

<h3>1. Star Wars 3 Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>The lightsaber duels were phenomenal. The plot twist was so epic and the ending was so tragic.</p>

<h3>2. Avengers' Endgame</h3>
<p>The Movie had no boring moment. You'd literraly be glued to the screen for the almost 3 hours that it was on</p>

<h3>3. Captain Marvel</h3>
<p>The Movie really showed us Carol's power. It was perfectly linked to when Nick Furry called Her. But how did fury know to call her?</p>
